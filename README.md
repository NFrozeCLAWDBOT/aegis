# Aegis

AI Regulatory Compliance Mapper — turn the fragmented, multi-jurisdictional regulatory maze into a single, actionable compliance tracker.

## What it does

## Frameworks covered

- EU AI Act
- UK GDPR / DPA 2018
- ICO AI Guidance
- NIST AI RMF
- OWASP GenAI Governance Checklist
- UK Equality Act 2010

## Tech stack
